excerpt: 'Two-matrix continuous carbon fibre composites are recognized for enhancing structural and mechanical properties. However, a comprehensive investigation into their interfacial behaviour and potential has yet to be undertaken. Based on the 3D printing process, this study uses experimental and simulation techniques to analyse the mechanical and interfacial performance across multiple scales. The flexure properties under different processing parameters are studied at the macro level. Meso and micro-structural characterization are evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. The disparities in simulations and experimental results are attributed to macroscopic defects and reinforcement volume fraction. This yields insights into strategies for optimising performance, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of the fracture mechanism of two-matrix continuous carbon fibre composites. Our study provides an approach to creating and analysing other systems with multiple matrix composites and enabling new engineering applications for composites.'
