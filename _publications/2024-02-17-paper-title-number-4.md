excerpt: 'The interfacial bonding properties of 3D-printed continuous carbon fibre composites are strongly influenced by the thermal history related to various printing parameters. However, there remains a gap in understanding the effects of thermal history on specific properties across multiple scales. This study addresses the gap in understanding these effects across multiple scales by developing a numerical temperature model, a computational fluid dynamics model and a representative volume element approach for the deposition process. The temperature model was validated against experimental profiles, where the maximum mean absolute difference is 4.5 Â°C, and the flexural performance with 29.8% error is obtained. Through two models, we found that print speed and layer thickness have a significant impact on interfacial bonding and defect formation. This study provides insights into the relationship between thermal history and interfacial behaviour, aiding machine developers in enhancing structural performance, and promoting the application of high-quality composites.'
